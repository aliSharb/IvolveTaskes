# SSH Configuration Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to set up an SSH alias for connecting to an AWS EC2 instance with a simplified command.

## Prerequisites
- A private key file  `id_rsa`  stored in `~/.ssh/`.

## Steps to Configure SSH Alias

### Step 1: Open the SSH Config File
Run the following command to open (or create) the SSH config file:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

### Step 2: Add SSH Configuration
Add the following block at the end of the file:

```ini
Host ivolve
    HostName 34.203.31.221
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Step 3: Set Correct File Permissions
To ensure security, restrict access to the SSH config file:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

### Step 5: Test SSH Connection

```RUN command
ssh ivolve
```

This will automatically use the correct username, private key, and IP address.
